## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **UI**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
- **Programming Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Authentication: Google OAuth via Supabase

Based on our discussion, the application will use Supabase for authentication, with Google as the primary OAuth provider. This provides a secure and streamlined login experience for users.

### AI Services: External Integration

The core AI functionalities for audio transcription and speech feedback will be handled by an external service, as you've specified. The Next.js application will feature API routes (`/api/transcribe` and `/api/feedback`) that will act as a proxy to this service. This architecture keeps the frontend decoupled from the AI implementation details.

## Proposed Database Schema

To support the application's features, the following database schema is proposed. It is designed for scalability and the feedback table is specifically designed to be extensible and configurable as requested.

### `profiles` table

Stores public user data, linked to Supabase's `auth.users` table.

| Column       | Type          | Constraints                                 | Description                      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `uuid`        | Primary Key, Foreign Key to `auth.users.id` | User's unique identifier.        |
| `full_name`  | `text`        |                                             | User's full name.                |
| `avatar_url` | `text`        |                                             | URL for the user's avatar image. |
| `created_at` | `timestamptz` | `NOT NULL`                                  | Timestamp of profile creation.   |

### `recordings` table

Stores metadata for each audio recording.

| Column             | Type          | Constraints                    | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`               | `uuid`        | Primary Key                    | Unique identifier for the recording.                  |
| `user_id`          | `uuid`        | Foreign Key to `auth.users.id` | The user who created the recording.                   |
| `storage_path`     | `text`        | `NOT NULL`                     | Path to the audio file in Supabase Storage.           |
| `duration_seconds` | `integer`     |                                | Duration of the recording in seconds.                 |
| `transcript`       | `text`        | `nullable`                     | The transcribed text of the recording.                |
| `status`           | `text`        | `default: 'pending'`           | e.g., 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'. |
| `created_at`       | `timestamptz` | `NOT NULL`                     | Timestamp of recording creation.                      |

### `feedback` table

Stores the analysis and feedback for each recording. The `feedback_data` column uses `jsonb` to allow for a flexible and extensible structure.

| Column          | Type          | Constraints                              | Description                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | `uuid`        | Primary Key                              | Unique identifier for the feedback.                                                   |
| `recording_id`  | `uuid`        | Foreign Key to `recordings.id`, `UNIQUE` | The recording this feedback belongs to.                                               |
| `user_id`       | `uuid`        | Foreign Key to `auth.users.id`           | The user who owns the feedback.                                                       |
| `feedback_data` | `jsonb`       | `NOT NULL`                               | Flexible JSONB field to store detailed, extensible feedback data from the AI service. |
| `created_at`    | `timestamptz` | `NOT NULL`                               | Timestamp of feedback creation.                                                       |

## UI/Branding Direction (For Discussion)

As a starting point for our discussion on UI and branding, here is a proposed direction:

- **Overall Feel**: Clean, modern, and professional to instill confidence in users who are practicing for professional interviews.
- **Color Palette**:
  - **Primary**: A trustworthy and calm shade of blue (e.g., `slate-700` from Tailwind CSS).
  - **Accent**: A brighter color for calls-to-action (e.g., `sky-500`).
  - **Text**: Dark gray (`gray-800`) for readability.
  - **Background**: White (`#FFFFFF`) and light gray (`slate-50`) for a clean look.
- **Typography**: A highly-readable, modern sans-serif font like **Inter**. It's versatile for both headings and body text.
- **Logo**: We should aim for a simple, memorable logo. If one doesn't exist, we can use a text-based logo initially.

This provides a solid foundation that we can refine together.

## Architecture

This project employs a hybrid rendering approach and a mobile-first design philosophy to optimize for performance and user experience.

### Mobile-First Design

The UI is built with a mobile-first approach. This means that styling and layout are designed for small screens first, and then scaled up for tablets and desktops using responsive design principles. This ensures a seamless user experience across all devices.

### Landing Pages vs Post-Login Pages: Clear Separation

Our application uses a strategic separation between public landing pages and authenticated user experiences to optimize performance and security.

#### **Landing Pages (Public - SSG)**

- **Purpose**: Marketing, SEO, user acquisition
- **Rendering**: Static Site Generation (SSG)
- **Content**: Static, non-user-specific information
- **Examples**: Homepage, About, Pricing, Contact, Features
- **Benefits**:
  - Lightning-fast loading times
  - Perfect SEO optimization
  - Global CDN distribution
  - Zero server-side processing per request

#### **Post-Login Pages (Protected - CSR)**

- **Purpose**: User-specific functionality and data
- **Rendering**: Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- **Content**: Dynamic, user-specific data
- **Examples**: Dashboard, Recording Sessions, Feedback Reports, Profile
- **Benefits**:
  - Real-time data updates
  - Secure user data handling
  - Interactive user experiences
  - No sensitive data in server-rendered HTML

### Static Site Generation (SSG) for Landing Pages

The public-facing pages are statically generated at build time. This results in incredibly fast load times and excellent SEO.

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for Authenticated Routes

After a user logs in, the application transitions to a client-side rendering model. This is ideal for displaying user-specific, dynamic data in a secure and interactive way.

### Resolving CSR vs SSR Conflicts

Our hybrid approach eliminates conflicts between Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) through strategic architecture decisions:

#### **1. Route-Based Separation**

```
Public Routes (SSG - No Conflicts):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ / (landing page)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /about
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /pricing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /contact

Protected Routes (CSR - No Conflicts):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /record
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /feedback
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /profile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /settings
```

#### **2. Authentication Boundary**

- **Pre-authentication**: Users interact with SSG pages (fast, SEO-optimized)
- **Post-authentication**: Application transitions to CSR for dynamic content
- **Clear separation**: No overlap between SSG and CSR rendering contexts

#### **3. Component Architecture**

```typescript
// Landing Page Component (SSG - No Client State)
export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className="landing-container">
      {/* Static content, no client-side state */}
      <HeroSection />
      <FeaturesSection />
      <TestimonialsSection />
    </div>
  );
}

// Dashboard Component (CSR - Dynamic State)
("use client");
export default function Dashboard() {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);
  const [recordings, setRecordings] = useState([]);

  // Dynamic content with client-side state
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
      {/* User-specific content */}
      <UserStats userData={userData} />
      <RecordingHistory recordings={recordings} />
      <RecentFeedback />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **4. Performance Optimization Strategy**

- **Landing Pages**:
  - Static HTML served from CDN
  - Zero JavaScript for initial render
  - Perfect Core Web Vitals scores
- **Dashboard Pages**:
  - JavaScript bundles loaded only when needed
  - Client-side state management
  - Real-time data fetching

#### **5. Security Implementation**

- **Public pages**: No sensitive data exposure
- **Protected pages**: Authentication required, data secured
- **No hydration mismatches**: SSG and CSR are completely separate

#### **6. SEO and Performance Benefits**

- **Landing pages**: Fully indexed, fast loading
- **Dashboard pages**: User-specific, no SEO requirements
- **No conflicts**: Each page type optimized for its specific use case

- `lib/`: Contains utility functions and the Supabase client configuration.
- `styles/`: Contains global styles.
- `public/`: Contains static assets like images and fonts.
- `supabase/`: Contains Supabase-specific configurations and database migrations.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit testing.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

All new components and utility functions should have corresponding unit tests.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the project files.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite.

## Performance & Scalability

- Audio recordings are stored in Supabase Storage under the `recordings/` bucket. Consider enabling a CDN and setting lifecycle rules for pruning old files if storage cost is a concern.
- The application streams audio uploads directly to the storage backend; no files live on the Next.js server, keeping memory usage constant regardless of upload size.
- For production, configure Supabase‚Äôs Storage egress and Postgres connection limits according to your expected traffic.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Recording not working:**

- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Ensure HTTPS in production (required for audio API)
- Try refreshing the page
- Verify microphone is not being used by other applications
- Check browser console for permission errors

**Processing taking too long:**

- Check internet connection
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Audio file size should be under 10MB
- Ensure stable network connection for upload

**Authentication issues:**

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Verify Supabase configuration
- Check environment variables

### Microphone Setup Guide

1. **Browser Permissions**: Click the microphone icon in your browser's address bar.
2. **System Permissions**: Ensure microphone access is enabled in system settings.
3. **Test Recording**: Use browser's built-in microphone test.
4. **Refresh Page**: Reload if permissions were recently granted.
